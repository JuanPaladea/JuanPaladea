## üìÇ Projects

### [Hospital Backend](https://github.com/JuanPaladea/hospital-backend)

Developed a robust backend for a comprehensive healthcare management system using Node.js, TypeScript, and Express. The system securely handles sensitive data related to patients, studies, and billing through well-designed RESTful API endpoints. Key features include secure user authentication with JWT-based sessions stored as HTTP‚Äëonly cookies, file uploads for study results and payment proofs using Multer. The architecture follows industry best practices with a clear separation of concerns among controllers, services, routes, and middleware, and utilizes PostgreSQL as the primary database.

### [E-Commerce Backend](https://github.com/JuanPaladea/ecommerce-nodejs)

Robust backend for an e-commerce platform using Node.js, TypeScript, and Express. Implemented key features such as user authentication and authorization, with secure JWT-based sessions. Integrated MongoDB to manage data models for cart, orders, products, and users, with seamless interaction through RESTful API endpoints. Ensured the system's reliability with automated tests using Jest, and provided comprehensive API documentation with Swagger. The architecture follows best practices, with a clear separation of concerns including services, controllers, routes and middlewares. Integrated logging using Winston for tracking system activity, and utilized dotenv for secure environment management.

### [Hospital Frontend](https://github.com/JuanPaladea/hospital-frontend)

Built a modern, responsive frontend for the healthcare management system using React and Vite. The interface provides dynamic dashboards, interactive lists, and intuitive forms for managing patient records, studies, and billing information. It seamlessly integrates with the secure backend API to support user authentication, data retrieval, and file upload functionalities. Advanced features include search, filtering, and pagination, along with a mobile-first design using Tailwind CSS to ensure accessibility and performance. Custom hooks such as debouncing improve responsiveness, and the overall component-based architecture ensures scalability and maintainability.

### [IMIPP - Research Institute Landing Page](https://github.com/JuanPaladea/imipp)

Responsive and dynamic landing page for a research institute using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, deployed on Vercel. The application fetches data from a backend built with Firestore/Firebase and follows best practices in frontend development. The page features a modular architecture with separate components and pages, managed using React Router DOM for smooth navigation. Additionally, it includes a contact form integrated with EmailJS, enabling seamless communication. The design is modern and mobile-friendly, ensuring a user-centric experience across devices.
